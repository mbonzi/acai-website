# acai-website
This is a sample website based off of an acai and juice bar in my region. 
There is a colorful design with lots of photos on each page. 
Interactive features allow for ordering via phone to each location or by a 3rd party website. 
Nav link and footer on each page allow for easy navigation for the user. 
Primarily written in HTML with use of Bootstrap, CSS, and jQuery. 
This code was written by me without template of the original website. Photos retrieved from the restaurant's social media and from Unsplash.com. 
Font Awesome used for icons in the nav bar and page footers.
